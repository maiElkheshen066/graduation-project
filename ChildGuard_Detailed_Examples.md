## 10. BLE Proximity Detection - Real-World Example

**Scenario: Sarah wants to know when Emma is nearby**

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Emma's device broadcasts BLE signal** continuously:
   ```
   Device ID: ESP32-ABC123
   Signal Strength: -45 dBm
   Battery Level: 85%
   ```
2. **Sarah's phone runs background BLE scan** for known devices
3. **Phone detects Emma's device** and measures signal strength
4. **Phone calculates proximity** based on signal strength:
   - Strong signal (-30 to -50 dBm) = Very Close (0-5 meters)
   - Medium signal (-50 to -70 dBm) = Nearby (5-20 meters)
   - Weak signal (-70 to -90 dBm) = Far (20-50 meters)
   - No signal = Out of range
5. **Phone determines Emma is nearby** (signal strength: -55 dBm)
6. **App sends proximity alert** to Sarah
7. **Sarah receives notification**: "Emma is nearby"
8. **Sarah can see proximity status** in the app
